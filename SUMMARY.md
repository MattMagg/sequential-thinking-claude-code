# Summary of Changes: sequential-thinking-dev Tool

This document summarizes all the changes and fixes applied during the development conversation for the `sequential-thinking-dev` tool.

## 1. Initial Enhancements and Improvements (v0.0.3)

- **Dynamic Tool Discovery**: Automatically fetch all available tools from the MCP client using `tools/list` and inject into the server, eliminating the need for manual tool lists.
- **Session Continuity**: Introduced a `sessionId` via `crypto.randomUUID()` and included it in every `processThought` response for consistent tracking.
- **Documentation Updates**:
  - Updated `schema.ts` to remove the old initialization notice and document automatic discovery.
  - Refined wording in `README.md` to accurately describe feature behavior and removed over‑blown phrasing.
  - Bumped version to **0.0.3** and recorded these changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Code Restructuring**:
  - Moved server instantiation and tool discovery into `runServer()`.
  - Matched `callTool` handler against `SEQUENTIAL_THINKING_TOOL.name` instead of a hard‑coded string.
  - Cleaned up inline development comments.
- **Build Artifacts**: Recompiled TypeScript sources so `dist/` outputs reflect the new logic and docs.

## 2. Zod Dependency Fix and Patch Version Bump (v0.0.4)

- **Missing Dependencies**: Added `zod` and `zod-to-json-schema` to `package.json` to resolve ESM import errors in the MCP SDK.
- **Version Bump**: Updated package version to **0.0.4** and documented this patch in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## 3. TypeScript Compilation Fixes

- **RPC Method Alignment**: Corrected the RPC call to use the literal `"tools/list"` method and imported the corresponding `ListToolsResultSchema`.
- **Schema Validation**: Updated `src/index.ts` to validate against `ListToolsResultSchema`, ensuring `listResponse.tools` is recognized and typed properly.
- **Rebuild**: Ran `pnpm run build` to confirm that TypeScript compiled without errors.

## 4. User Instructions for Testing

1. Install dependencies (including the newly added Zod libs):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Rebuild the project to regenerate `dist/`:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
3. Launch the MCP server:
   ```bash
   node dist/index.js
   ```

With these steps applied, the sequential-thinking-dev tool is now robustly configured with automatic tool discovery, session continuity, correct type handling, and proper documentation.
