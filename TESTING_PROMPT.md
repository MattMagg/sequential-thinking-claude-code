# Sequential Thinking Tool Evaluation

## Context

You have access to a sequential thinking tool that provides capabilities for complex problem-solving through structured reasoning. The tool supports features for managing multi-step analysis, handling complex decision flows, and maintaining context across reasoning steps.

## Test Objective

Use the sequential thinking tool to solve a complex problem that would benefit from:
- Multi-step analytical reasoning
- Handling complex decision points
- Managing context across reasoning steps
- Exploring different aspects of the problem systematically

## Test Scenario

**Task**: Design a comprehensive data processing pipeline for cryptocurrency price prediction that handles multiple data sources, feature engineering, and model selection.

**Problem Requirements**:
- Integrate data from multiple sources (exchanges, social media, news, on-chain metrics)
- Design feature engineering pipeline for time-series and cross-sectional features
- Select appropriate forecasting models and ensemble strategies
- Handle data quality, missing values, and real-time processing requirements
- Consider computational efficiency and scalability constraints

**Complexity Factors**:
- Multiple interconnected decision points
- Subtasks that build upon each other
- Trade-offs between different approaches
- Need to revisit earlier decisions as understanding develops
- Context from earlier analysis that becomes relevant later

## Instructions

Use the sequential thinking tool to work through this cryptocurrency prediction pipeline design. Approach the problem systematically, allowing your reasoning to develop naturally as you work through the various components and considerations.

Focus on creating a comprehensive solution that addresses all aspects of the problem while maintaining clear reasoning throughout the process.
