# mcp-sequentialthinking-tools

An adaptation of the
[MCP Sequential Thinking Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/main/src/sequentialthinking/index.ts)
modified to work with MCP tools. This server maintains the core sequential thinking capabilities
while being restructured to better integrate with the MCP tools ecosystem.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables structured, sequential
thinking through a flexible thought process. It helps break down complex
problems into manageable steps while maintaining context and allowing for
revisions and branching paths.

## Features

- ü§î Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through sequential
  thoughts
- üîÑ Flexible thinking process that adapts and evolves
- üå≥ Support for branching and revision of thoughts
- üìù Step tracking with expected outcomes
- üîÑ Progress monitoring with previous and remaining steps
- üí≠ Thought history tracking
- üåø Branch management for exploring alternatives
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Revision support for updating previous thoughts
- üéØ Step-by-step problem breakdown

## Configuration

This server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are
examples for different environments:

### Cline Configuration

Add this to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-sequentialthinking-tools": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"]
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration

For WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-sequentialthinking-tools": {
			"command": "wsl.exe",
			"args": [
				"bash",
				"-c",
				"source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh && /home/username/.nvm/versions/node/v20.12.1/bin/npx mcp-sequentialthinking-tools"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

## API

The server implements a single MCP tool with configurable parameters:

### sequentialthinking_tools

A tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts,
supporting branching and revision of ideas.

Parameters:

- `thought` (string, required): Your current thinking step
- `next_thought_needed` (boolean, required): Whether another thought
  step is needed
- `thought_number` (integer, required): Current thought number
- `total_thoughts` (integer, required): Estimated total thoughts
  needed
- `is_revision` (boolean, optional): Whether this revises previous
  thinking
- `revises_thought` (integer, optional): Which thought is being
  reconsidered
- `branch_from_thought` (integer, optional): Branching point thought
  number
- `branch_id` (string, optional): Branch identifier
- `needs_more_thoughts` (boolean, optional): If more thoughts are
  needed
- `current_step` (object, optional): Current step details with:
  - `step_description`: What needs to be done
  - `recommended_tools`: Array of tool recommendations
  - `expected_outcome`: What to expect from this step
  - `next_step_conditions`: Conditions for next step
- `previous_steps` (array, optional): Steps already taken
- `remaining_steps` (array, optional): High-level descriptions of
  upcoming steps
