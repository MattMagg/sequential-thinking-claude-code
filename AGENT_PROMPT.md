# Sequential Thinking Enhancement Task

## Context

The directory `internal/Tools/mcp-tools/sequential-thinking-dev/` contains a development copy of the sequential thinking MCP tool from `internal/Tools/mcp-tools/sequential-thinking/`. This copy was created to investigate and address issues with how AI agents utilize the tool's advanced features.

## Problem Statement

AI agents consistently use the sequential thinking tool (`sequentialthinking_tools_sequential-thinking-tools`) in a linear fashion only. The advanced features for revision (`is_revision: true`, `revises_thought: N`) and branching (`branch_from_thought: N`, `branch_id: "string"`) remain unused despite being available and beneficial for problem-solving.

## Task Objective

Develop an approach for AI agents to dynamically utilize revision and branching features in the sequential thinking tool for better task management, context handling, and problem-solving effectiveness.

## Required Behavioral Changes

### Implement Revision Usage:
- When new information contradicts or enhances previous thoughts
- When revisiting earlier reasoning for context in long conversations
- When better understanding emerges that improves previous analysis

### Implement Branching Usage:
- For handling subtasks before returning to main thought flow
- For exploring alternative approaches when uncertainty exists
- For investigating side questions that support the main objective
- For breaking down complex problems into manageable parts

## Implementation Approach

The solution should enable agents to:
1. Recognize opportunities for revision and branching during sequential thinking
2. Apply these features naturally when they improve problem-solving
3. Maintain thought flow by returning to main branch after side investigations
4. Build on previous context by referencing and revising earlier thoughts

## Success Criteria

- Agents use revision when new information enhances previous thinking
- Branching occurs naturally for subtasks and alternative exploration
- Previous thoughts are revisited when context becomes relevant
- Complex problems are broken down using the full sequential thinking feature set

## Development Files

- `ISSUES.md` - Documented problems with current usage patterns
- `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - General guidance for addressing the primary issue
- Source code in `src/` directory (copied from original tool)
