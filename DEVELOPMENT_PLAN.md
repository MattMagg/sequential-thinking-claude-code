# Sequential Thinking Tool Development Plan

## Primary Objective

Enable AI agents to dynamically utilize revision and branching features for intelligent task management, context handling, and problem-solving effectiveness.

## Current State

AI agents use sequential thinking in linear fashion only. Advanced features (`is_revision: true`, `branch_from_thought`, `branch_id`) remain unused despite being available.

## Target Behavior

Agents should autonomously:
- Revise previous thoughts when new information provides better context
- Branch from main thought flow to handle subtasks
- Return to main branch after completing side investigations
- Revisit earlier thoughts for context in long conversations
- Use branching to explore alternative approaches when uncertainty exists

## Development Approach

The solution requires agents to develop intelligent decision-making about when and how to use revision and branching features. This is primarily a behavioral/intelligence challenge rather than a technical limitation.

## Key Areas for Investigation

### Decision Triggers
Identify patterns and conditions that should prompt revision or branching behavior in agents.

### Context Management
Develop agent understanding of when previous thoughts become relevant again and should be revisited.

### Task Flow Intelligence
Enable agents to recognize subtasks, alternative approaches, and natural branching points in problem-solving.

### Session Continuity
Maintain awareness of ongoing sequential thinking sessions across conversation turns.

## Success Indicators

- Agents naturally branch for subtasks without explicit instruction
- Previous thoughts are revisited when context becomes relevant
- Alternative approaches are explored through branching when appropriate
- Revision occurs when new information contradicts or enhances previous thinking
- Complex problems are broken down using the full feature set

## Secondary Issues

- Tool discovery claims accuracy
- Session state persistence
- Conversation flow awareness
- Documentation alignment with capabilities
