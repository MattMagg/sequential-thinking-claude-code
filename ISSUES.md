# Sequential Thinking Tool Issues

## Primary Issue

### Lack of Dynamic Revision and Branching Intelligence
**Status:** Critical
**Description:** AI agents do not dynamically utilize revision (`is_revision: true`) and branching (`branch_from_thought`) features for task management, context handling, and effectiveness optimization.

**Current Behavior:**
- Agents use sequential thinking in linear fashion only
- Revision and branching features remain unused despite being available
- No intelligent decision-making about when to revise previous thoughts
- No automatic branching for subtasks or alternative exploration
- Context from previous thoughts is not revisited when needed

**Impact:** Advanced sequential thinking capabilities go unused, limiting problem-solving effectiveness

## Secondary Issues

### Tool Discovery Claims
**Status:** High
**Description:** Tool claims to provide "intelligent tool recommendations" but has no built-in knowledge of available tools. Tool recommendations come from AI agent, not the tool itself.

### Session Continuity
**Status:** Medium
**Description:** No mechanism to maintain context across conversation turns. AI agents start fresh sessions instead of continuing existing ones.

### Conversation State Awareness
**Status:** Medium
**Description:** Tool lacks awareness of conversation flow patterns and cannot detect when revision or branching would be appropriate.

### Documentation Accuracy
**Status:** Low
**Description:** Repository documentation overstates current capabilities regarding tool discovery and intelligent recommendations.
